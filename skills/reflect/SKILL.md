# Reflect

Mine the current conversation for durable learnings, then route them into skill edits.

Invoke when the user says "reflect" or "/reflect". Skip when the conversation is trivial, off-topic, or already covered by an existing skill the parent followed correctly. One-offs are not learnings.

## 1. Locate the active transcript

Before fanning out, find this conversation's transcript in this workspace's folder, `~/.claude/projects/<slug>/`, where `<slug>` is the workspace path with each `/` and `.` changed to `-`. Do not glob across `~/.claude/projects/*/`. That crosses workspace boundaries and reads private chats from unrelated projects.

```bash
ls -t ~/.claude/projects/<slug>/*.jsonl 2>/dev/null | head -5
```

The newest file is usually this conversation. Subagent transcripts are in `<session>/subagents/`. Confirm the match by finding the conversation's opening user prompt in one of the file's first `user` entries. If none matches, pass a tight digest of the session instead.

## 2. Spawn three reviewers in parallel

One message, three `Agent` calls, `subagent_type: "onyo-reader"`. Reviewers need MCP access to look up the tickets, chat threads, and observability traces the transcript references, and `onyo-reader` keeps its MCP tools.

Each reviewer and the synthesizer name a role line in the `ostack-models.md` rule and a default. Set `model` and `effort` from that line's value, such as `opus high`, or from the default if the rule or the line is missing. Leave both unset when the value is `inherit`. If the Agent tool rejects a value, use the default and say so. If it rejects the default, use the closest valid effort for that model from its error message. Pick each subagent's reasoning level for the job, per the Subagents section of the **onyo-mode** skill.

| Lens | Role line | Default `model` | Prompt template |
|---|---|---|---|
| Judgment | `reflect judgment, divergent, synthesizer` | `opus high` | `references/judgment-reviewer.md` |
| Tooling | `reflect tooling` | `haiku high` | `references/tooling-reviewer.md` |
| Divergent | `reflect judgment, divergent, synthesizer` | `opus high` | `references/divergent-reviewer.md` |

Pass each template verbatim, substituting the transcript path or digest where marked. Reviewers return findings in the `Agent` response body.

## 3. Synthesize

One `Agent` call, `subagent_type: "onyo-reader"`, `model` and `effort` from the `reflect judgment, divergent, synthesizer` line (default `opus high`). It spot-verifies citations through MCP, which `onyo-reader` keeps. Pass `references/synthesizer.md` verbatim, with each reviewer's full output inlined where marked. It returns an Accepted / Rejected / Backlog list.

## 4. Structural enforcement check

Move any Accepted item that a lint rule, script, metadata flag, or runtime check would enforce more reliably to Backlog. See the **encode-lessons-in-structure** principle skill.

## 5. Apply

Present the synthesizer's full Accepted / Rejected / Backlog output and wait for explicit approval before applying any Accepted edit. The user picks the subset and may redirect routings. Skill changes affect every future agent in the org. Do not auto-apply.

File each Backlog item to your team's devex or backlog tracker without waiting. Only the Accepted list waits for approval.

Never edit a skill under `plugins/cache/`. Before approval, show its destination, `.claude/skills/<skill>/` or `~/.claude/skills/<skill>/`. After approval, copy the skill folder there and edit the copy. Never open a PR or push.

Follow each approved row's Routing exactly:

- Trivial existing-skill edit (a one-line bullet, a tightened sentence, a stale fact corrected): the parent does it directly.
- Substantive existing-skill edit (a new section, a new pattern table, more than ~10 lines): hand to the `skill-creator` skill and run its draft / test / iterate loop.
- `tune description: <skill path>` (the skill exists but didn't trigger when it should have): hand to `skill-creator` and run its description-optimization loop.
- `new skill via skill-creator: <kebab-name>`: hand creation to `skill-creator`. Do not invent the shape ad hoc.

If your environment ships a SKILL.md validator, run it on every touched skill before declaring done.

## 6. Summarize for the user

Short list, no preamble:

- Edits applied: `<skill path>`. What changed, one line each.
- New skills created: `<skill path>`. One line each (rare).
- Backlog filed to the devex tracker: `<issue title>` (`<tags>`). One line each.
- Dropped: one line per rejected finding + reason from the synthesizer.
